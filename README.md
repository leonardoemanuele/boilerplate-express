# Basic Node and Express

This is the boilerplate code for the Basic Node and Express Challenges. Instructions for working on these challenges start at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/basic-node-and-express/

* ## Start a Working Express Server
In the first two lines of the file `myApp.js`, you can see how easy it is to create an Express app object. This object has several methods, and you will learn many of them in these challenges. One fundamental method is `app.listen(port)`. It tells your server to listen on a given port, putting it in running state. For testing reasons, we need the app to be running in the background so we added this method in the `server.js` file for you.
